							<h1>How to start prep and the most important things before prep.</h1>

							<p>GRE is a very important exam especially if you are planning on pursuing 
                            further education in the Unites States. Before starting the prep you need to 
                            be mentally prepared that you are going to give the exam. You need to have 
                            the determination to study sincerely.</p>

							<p>Cracking GRE is not dependant on knowing all of the difficult concepts 
                            of Maths or have exceptional Verbal skills. It's about perseverence. This 
                            is a 4 hour long exam. The questions are not going to be super difficult or 
                            super complicated. They will be pretty easy and straightforward. What you 
                            need and what you need to develop is the ability to concentrate for 4 hours 
                            at a stretch. Usually that's what most people stuggle with. Usually towards 
                            the end of the paper, you feel exhausted and drained that you end up making 
                            silly errors and lose marks there. That is one of the most important things 
                            that you need to mentally prepare yourself for.</p>
							
							<p>If you watch English movies and series on a regular basis, then you 
                            already understand the accent and you will know the meaning of a lot more 
                            words than what you are aware of. But most of us Indians need to work on 
                            building up our vocabulary. As for Quants, the concepts are not anything new. 
                            We have all been introduced to these concepts when we were in school. It's 
                            just that the difficulty level of the questions based on these concepts 
                            will be higher. And by difficulty level, I don't mean that the solution 
                            will be long and tedious. You get approximately 1.5 minute per question. So 
                            the answer will be straightforward but it will be confusing. There will be a 
                            lot of similar options in front of you and you need to be careful of not 
                            making silly minor mistakes because that will cost you marks. So before 
                            starting doing verbal, you should take a diagnostic test. This will give 
                            you an idea of where you stand and will tell you how much more work you 
                            need to put in for to reach your goal. </p>

							<p>When you get a score below 300, then that means that there is a lot of 
                            scope for you to still improve. Once you cross 300, the progress will get 
                            a little slower but it is very much possible to get around 310 easily. 
                            After 310, the progress and the growth of your marks becomes slower and 
                            you will need to put in all the efforts to push them past 320 even. 320 
                            is generally considered a good score. Always set you aim higher than what 
                            you want to achieve. This will ensure that you have a little margint to 
                            fall back on incase you mess up on the test day. And if you are able to 
                            achieve more than your goals, then there's nothing like it.</p>

                            <p>That is why the <b>must do</b> things before starting your prep is to 
                            mentally prep yourself for the exam ahead by getting to know the pattern 
                            and the type of questions asked. The second thing is to give a diagnostic 
                            test. This is very important as it will give you a reality check and you 
                            can start you prep accordingly.</p>
